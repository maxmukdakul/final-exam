# final-exam
- From the starting code, polygon_art.py, you are to write an OO program that generates different pieces of art works
- Fork, then, clone this repo
- Read the instructions given in the course's Google Classroom and start coding
- Once you are done, push your final code to your Github repo and modify this README to report on the work you have done

# the error
- If you input the int more than 8
- If you input the int less than 1
- If you input the string
- If you input the float

# explain about the program
- First I change the def to the class
- Then it's the main part, you have to decide how to make the turtle walk 
  randomly
- Then get the input int from 1 to 8
- Every number have the different art
- 1 means random triangle
- 2 means random square
- 3 means random pentagon
- 4 means random triangle, square, pentagon
- 5 means random 3 triangle
- 6 means random 3 square
- 7 means random 3 pentagon
- 8 means random 3 triangle, square, pentagon
- Then about my program
- I use if and elif to make the conditions that the number you entered 
  will show you which art
- So you must try it :)
- Thanks :)
